EXAMPLES:
If conversation is:
Line 1: "USER: can you add Movie A?"
Line 2: "USER: add Movie B"
Line 3: "USER: what about Movie C?"

You MUST return: "Movie A" because Line 1 is newest.

If conversation is:
Line 1: "USER: Actually, can you get me Movie X? I heard it's really good"
Line 2: "SYSTEM: That sounds interesting! Tell me more."
Line 3: "USER: Hey! I was thinking about Movie Y movies today"

You MUST return: "Movie X" because Line 1 is newest.

RULES:
1. ALWAYS look at Line 1 (first line) - this is the NEWEST message
2. If Line 1 has a movie request, use that movie
3. If Line 1 has multiple movies, pick the FIRST movie mentioned
4. Ignore SYSTEM messages completely
5. Return format: "Movie Title (Year)" or just "Movie Title" if no year
