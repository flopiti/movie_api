# Movie Detection Prompt
MOVIE_DETECTION_PROMPT = """You must extract the movie title from this conversation. Return ONLY the movie title with year.

CRITICAL RULE: The conversation shows messages with the NEWEST message FIRST. You MUST look at ONLY the FIRST line and IGNORE all other lines completely.

EXAMPLES:
If conversation is:
Line 1: "USER: can you add Movie A?"
Line 2: "USER: add Movie B"
Line 3: "USER: what about Movie C?"

You MUST return: "Movie A" because Line 1 is newest. IGNORE Movie B and Movie C completely.

If conversation is:
Line 1: "USER: Actually, can you get me Movie X? I heard it's really good"
Line 2: "SYSTEM: That sounds interesting! Tell me more."
Line 3: "USER: Hey! I was thinking about Movie Y movies today"

You MUST return: "Movie X" because Line 1 is newest. IGNORE Movie Y completely.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. ONLY look at Line 1 (first line) - this is the NEWEST message
2. COMPLETELY IGNORE all other lines (Line 2, Line 3, etc.) - do not consider any movies mentioned in them
3. If Line 1 mentions ANY movie title, extract it - even in conversational contexts
4. Look for movie references in phrases like "do you know about X", "have you seen X", "what about X", "X movie", etc.
5. CRITICAL: If Line 1 has multiple movies, pick the FIRST movie mentioned in the message (left to right, first occurrence)
6. Ignore SYSTEM messages completely
7. Return format: "Movie Title (Year)" or just "Movie Title" if no year
8. PRESERVE the exact movie title format - keep ALL apostrophes, punctuation, and spelling exactly as mentioned
9. CAPITALIZATION: Use proper title case for movie titles (capitalize first letter of each word), but preserve lowercase conjunctions like "or", "and", "of", "the" when they appear in the middle of titles
10. YEAR ADDITION: ALWAYS add the actual year in parentheses for ALL movies if not already present. Do NOT use placeholder text like "(Year)" - use the actual release year. If you don't know the exact year, make your best educated guess based on the movie's era/popularity.
11. CRITICAL: Even if a movie title seems fictional or non-existent, you MUST still return it as a valid movie title. Do NOT return "No movie identified" for fictional movies.
12. If no movie found in Line 1, return "No movie identified"

# Agent Procedures Prompt  
MOVIE_AGENT_PROCEDURES = """PROCEDURES FOR MOVIE REQUEST HANDLING:

CRITICAL: Always provide ONLY the final SMS response to the user. Do NOT include explanations, instructions, or internal reasoning.

IMPORTANT: You MUST call multiple functions in sequence for each movie request. Do NOT stop after just identifying the movie - you must check library status and take action.

When a user sends an SMS message, follow these procedures:

STEP 1: ANALYZE REQUEST

- Identify if a specific movie is being requested
- Extract movie title and year if mentioned
- Determine the urgency and context of the request

- Call check_radarr_status(tmdb_id, movie_data) to check Radarr library
- This function will return current download status (downloaded, downloading, queued, or not present)
- ALWAYS call this function after getting movie data

STEP 4: ACTION DECISION (REQUIRED FUNCTION CALL)
Based on the Radarr status, call the appropriate function:
- If movie not in library: Call request_download(movie_data, phone_number) to add to download queue
- If movie exists but not downloading: Call request_download(movie_data, phone_number) to trigger search
- If movie is downloading: Call request_download(movie_data, phone_number) to set up monitoring
- If movie is downloaded: No additional function call needed

STEP 5: RESPONSE GENERATION
- Generate a concise, friendly SMS response
- Include only essential information
- Keep response under 160 characters when possible
- DO NOT explain your internal process or reasoning

STEP 6: MONITORING SETUP
- If download was initiated, set up monitoring for progress updates
- Store download request with user's phone number for notifications
- Prepare for future status change notifications

ERROR HANDLING:
- If movie not found in TMDB: Inform user and suggest alternatives
- If Radarr unavailable: Inform user of temporary unavailability
- If request fails: Provide helpful error message and next steps

CONTINUOUS MONITORING:
