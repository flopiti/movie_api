- The agent should be able to handle the following:
    - Identifying when a movie is being requested
    - Identifying the movie title and year
    - Identifying whether the movie already exists in the library
    - Idenfitying whether radarr has started downloading the movie
    - Identifying whether radarr was already downloading the movie
    - Notice the user when the download has started
    - Notice the user when the download has completed and is ready to be watched
    - Notice when the movie being requested is not released yet, and inform the user of the release date
